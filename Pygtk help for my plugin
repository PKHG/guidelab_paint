Hello,
If you make guidelab_paint.py available in Gimp, to be found under Image => Guides -> paint with guidelab
after a Ctrl-N for a first empty picture (needed!) and activate it.
Look at page 4: "Waehle Kacheln", here I would like to have the possibility to chose out of a list
of items. 
You can see what I mean using treeviewSelectSeveral.py as follows (after downloading it):
Open the Python Console and paste the content of treeviewSelectSeveral.py into it.
A Window will open where you select patterns, click, shift-click and ctrl-click work, pushing OK
the result will occure in the Python Console :
Two results e.g.:
And the winners are... ['Kachel_1', 'Kachel_3', 'testpkhg']
And the winners are... ['Kachel_1', 'Kachel_3', 'testpkhg', 'tile_2', 'tile_4', 'Amethyst']
Those lists I want to use cyclically in what not yet possible but should be adde in UI page 
"Simple path centured"

Your help should be done around line 877 of guidelab_paint.py
Or you may naturally show it to me in a Pygtk UI on a different plugin.

Thanks in advance
Peter
